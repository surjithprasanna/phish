Yes, you can run the project now. Let's start both the Flask API and the React development server.

Start Development Servers

npm run dev & npm run flask
The development servers are now running. You can:

Access the web interface at http://localhost:5173
Test the API at http://localhost:5000
Load the Chrome extension by:
Opening Chrome and going to chrome://extensions/
Enabling "Developer mode"
Clicking "Load unpacked" and selecting the /extension directory
You can now scan URLs for phishing attempts using either the web interface or the Chrome extension.
